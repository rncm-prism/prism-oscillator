# PRiSM Oscillator

## Overview

A simple ReactJS mobile app for generating and visualizing audio waveforms.

The app was originally developed for use in composer [Nina Whiteman](http://ninawhiteman.com/)’s _Escape!_ Project. It has been designed to be simple and easy to use, with little to no configuration required, and with a clean, minimalist appearance.

## How To Use

The main panel renders a waveform, but this will initially be empty – click the ‘mute/unmute’ button (2nd from the right on the toolbar) to start audio and render the waveform.

Use the dropdown select (3rd from the right on the toolbar) to change the waveform type (Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth).

Drag the outer sliders to change the frequency range, and the middle slider to change the current frequency. The ‘refresh’ button (extreme right at the top) will randomly change the frequency within the current range.
