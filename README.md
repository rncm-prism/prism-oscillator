# PRiSM Oscillator

A simple ReactJS mobile app for generating and visualizing audio waveforms. Targets iOS and Android, with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (contains no React Native code).

The app was originally developed for use in composer [Nina Whiteman](http://ninawhiteman.com/)â€™s _Escape!_ Project. It has been designed to be simple and easy to use, with little to no configuration required, and with a clean, minimalist appearance.
